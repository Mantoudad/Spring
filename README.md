# Spring
A project to learn how to get a Spring up and running.  


*It should utilize JSTL none of the bullshit old jsp tags. 
*It should use Hibernate for the ORM
*It should use Servlet 3
*It should use Maven as a package manager.  
*This is the best place to get packages for maven http://mvnrepository.com/
*Java 8 just came out not more than a couple of months ago.  It has some pretty cool features.  We can either use that or Java 7.  Whichever. 
*Tomcat 8 just cam out as well but seemed to be buggy last time I tried to use it.  We can use Tomcat 7  its what I use for production now.  
*Charset/encoding should be UTF-8.  Make sure the database is setup as such. 
*Database should be MySql.  
*Make sure Collation is setup for utf8-general-ci or something similar.  
*AES is the new standard for encryption so we should try to look into that.  I haven’t done much research on it yet but we were recently criticized for not using it.  
*Unique ID’s should be dealt with, with UUID’s.  It seems to be the new standard.  Atomic integers are becoming old news.
